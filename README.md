 Project Overview

Mood-Based Music Player is an interactive Python application that recommends and plays songs based on the user’s current mood.
It includes aesthetic console animations, random song selection, ASCII music visualization, and automatic YouTube integration to provide a fun and engaging experience.
It uses animations,ASCII visualizers, mood detection inputs, and real-time browser launching to create an engaging experience.


 Objectives

To create a Python program using functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionaries.

To implement decision-making using Python.

To organisze music into categorized playlists.

To build a mood-based recommendation system.

To develop a console-based UI with animations.

To demonstrate practical use of Python modules like random, time, itertools, and webbrowser.

To build a simple yet creative application that enhances user experience.


 Key Features

 1. Mood Detection Input

User can choose one of the following moods:

Happy

Sad

Romantic

Study

Motivational

Party
Each mood triggers a specific curated music playlist.



 2. Dynamic Loading Animation

A rotating spinner animation simulates “mood analysis” process and makes the program feel alive.



 3. ASCII Music Visualizer

Before playing a song, a visual sound-bar animation enhances user experience with a “DJ-console” vibe.



 4. YouTube Music Auto-Play

After selecting a mood, the program automatically opens a randomly selected YouTube song in the user’s browser.



 5. Continuous Program Loop

After playing a song, the user can choose whether to continue or exit the program gracefully.



 Technologies & Libraries Used

All modules used are built-in Python libraries, making this project simple and portable:

time – for smooth delays and animations

random – for choosing random music

itertools – for looping loading symbols

webbrowser – for opening YouTube links

sys – for real-time console updates



 Code Structure

 Mood-Based-Music-Player
│
├── mood_player.py   # Main source code
└── README.md        # Project documentation


How it Works

1.The User selects a mood


2.The Program validates input


3.Aloading animation is displayed


4. Displays music visualizer


5. Opens a random YouTube song


6. The process repeats until user exits



 How to Run This Program

1. Install Python 3


2. Save the script as mood_player.py


3. Open Command Prompt / Terminal


4. Run:

python mood_player.py

5. Choose your mood → Enjoy the music



 Academic Importance

This project showcases my skills in:

1. Python fundamentals
2. Conditional statements
3. Functions & modular code
4. Dictionaries as databases
5. Loops & animations
6. Real-world integration (YouTube)
7. User Interface experience


 Possible Future Enhancements

1.Add GUI using Tkinter

2.Add voice-based mood input

3.Add more categories like workout, calm, lo-fi

4.Create a local MP3 player version

5.Add a login system to save user preferences

6.Integrate real emotion detection using ML 


Final Note

This project combines music, mood, creativity, technical logic, calmness and Python into one smooth  and enjoyable experience.
